for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
    print("Hi", name, "Please come to my party on Saturday!")
## so in the above code we atttach each of the name in the list to the string in the print statements
for achar in "Go Spot Go":
    print(achar)
## The for loops iterate eachcharacter of the strings
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]

for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:      # repeat four times

## so in the above turtle program instead of repeating statements we usd for loops to iterate the code block

## we used the values in the list to change the attributes of alex


Write code to create a list of integers from 0 through 52 and assign that list to the variable numbers. You should use a special Python function – do not type out the whole list yourself. HINT: You can do this in one line of code!
numbers=list(range(0,53))
print(numbers)
Count the number of characters in string str1. Do not use len(). Save the number in variable numbs.
str1 = "I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living."
count = 0
for i in str1:
    count  =  count + 1
    
numbs = count
print(numbs)

Create a list of numbers 0 through 40 and assign this list to the variable numbers. Then, accumulate the total of the list’s values and assign that sum to the variable sum1.
numbers = list(range(41))
sum1=0
for values in numbers:
    sum1 +=values
print(sum1)

Image processing
import image
img = image.Image("luther.jpg")

print(img.getWidth())
print(img.getHeight())

p = img.getPixel(30, 100)
print(p.getRed(), p.getGreen(), p.getBlue())

Write one for loop to print out each character of the string my_str on a separate line.
my_str = "MICHIGAN"

for chars in my_str:
    print(chars)

Write one for loop to print out each element of the list several_things. Then, write another for loop to print out the TYPE of each element of the list several_things. To complete this problem you should have written two different for loops, each of which iterates over the list several_things, but each of those 2 for loops should have a different result.
several_things = ["hello", 2, 4, 6.0, 7.5, 234352354, "the end", "", 99]
for elem in several_things:
    print(elem)
for types in several_things:
    print(type(types))

Write code that uses iteration to print out the length of each element of the list stored in str_list.
str_list = ["hello", "", "goodbye", "wonderful", "I love Python"]
count = 0
# Write your code here.
for num in str_list:
    print(len(num))
        
print(count)
print(str_list)

Write code to count the number of characters in original_str using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_chars. Do NOT use the len function to solve the problem (if you use it while you are working on this problem, comment it out afterward!)

original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."

num_chars = 0
for char in original_str:
    num_chars += 1
print(num_chars)

addition_str is a string with a list of numbers separated by the + sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to take the sum of all of the numbers and assigns it to sum_val (an integer). (You should use the .split("+") function to split by "+" and int() to cast to an integer).

addition_str = "2+5+10+20"
sum_val=0
t = addition_str.split("+")
for val in t:
    sum_val += int(val)
print(sum_val)    

week_temps_f is a string with a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by the , sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the average (sum divided by number of items) and assigns it to avg_temp. Do not hard code your answer (i.e., make your code compute both the sum or the number of items in week_temps_f) (You should use the .split(",") function to split by "," and float() to cast to a float).
week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"

avg = 0
temp = week_temps_f.split(",")
for val in temp:
    avg += float(val)
    avg_temp  = avg / len(temp)
print(avg)

Write code to create a list of numbers from 0 to 67 and assign that list to the variable nums. Do not hard code the list.

nums = list(range(0,68))
print(nums)

Write code to create a list of word lengths for the words in original_str using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_words_list. (You should use the len function).
original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox"
split_str = original_str.split()
num_words_list=[]
for words in split_str:
    num_words_list.append(len(words))

Create an empty string and assign it to the variable lett. Then using range, write code such that when your code is run, lett has 7 b’s ("bbbbbbb").


lett = ""
for code in range(7):
    let = 'b'
lett = 'b'*7
