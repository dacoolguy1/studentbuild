The in operatrion checks if the operatrion in the LHS is a member of the operation on the RHS and returns a boolean value

The not in operation does the reverse of the in operation . it checks if the LHS is not a member of the RHS and returns a boolean value
In python the precedence of operation are as follows
The arithmetic operation first: exponential,multiplication,addition and substraction
The relational operators next: ==,!=,<=,>=,>,<
The logical operators lastly: not,and ,or
Conditional execution uses if,elif and else
The accumulator pattern: the variable is first initialized, then  iterated over the sequence and updated as the iteration occurs

Write code to assign the string "You can apply to SI!" to output if the string "SI 106" is in the list courses. If it is not in courses, assign the value "Take SI 106!" to the variable output.
courses = ["ENGR 101", "SI 110", "ENG 125", "SI 106", "CHEM 130"]
if "SI 106" in courses:
    output="You can apply to SI!"
else:
     output="Take SI 106!" 

Create a variable, b, and assign it the value of 15. Then, write code to see if the value b is greater than that of a. If it is, a’s value should be multiplied by 2. If the value of b is less than or equal to a, nothing should happen. Finally, create variable c and assign it the value of the sum of a and b.
a = 20

b=15

if b>a:
    a*2
else:
    print("")
c = a+b

Create one conditional to find whether “false” is in string str1. If so, assign variable output the string “False. You aren’t you?”. Check to see if “true” is in string str1 and if it is then assign “True! You are you!” to the variable output. If neither are in str1, assign “Neither true nor false!” to output.
str1 = "Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!"

if 'false' in str1:
    output =False
elif 'true!' in str1:
    output= "True! You are you!"
else:
    output = "Neither true nor false!"

Create an empty list called resps. Using the list percent_rain, for each percent, if it is above 90, add the string ‘Bring an umbrella.’ to resps, otherwise if it is above 80, add the string ‘Good for the flowers?’ to resps, otherwise if it is above 50, add the string ‘Watch out for clouds!’ to resps, otherwise, add the string ‘Nice day!’ to resps. Note: if you’re sure you’ve got the problem right but it doesn’t pass, then check that you’ve matched up the strings exactly.
percent_rain = [94.3, 45, 100, 78, 16, 5.3, 79, 86]

resps = []
for i in percent_rain:
    if i > 90:
        resps.append("Bring an umbrella.")
    elif i >80:
        resps.append("Good for the flowers?")                   
    elif i > 50:
        resps.append("Watch out for clouds!")
    else:
        resps.append("Nice day!")
We have created conditionals for you to use. Do not change the provided conditional statements. Find an integer value for x that will cause output to hold the values True and None. (Drawing diagrams or flow charts for yourself may help!)

x =65
output = []

if x > 63:
    output.append(True)
elif x > 55:
    output.append(False)
else:
    output.append("Neither")

if x > 67:
    output.append(True)
else:
    output.append(None)
For each string in the list words, find the number of characters in the string. If the number of characters in the string is greater than 3, add 1 to the variable num_words so that num_words should end up with the total number of words with more than 3 characters.

words = ["water", "chair", "pen", "basket", "hi", "car"]
num_words = 0
for str in words:
    if len(str) > 3:
        num_words += 1
 For each word in words, add ‘d’ to the end of the word if the word ends in “e” to make it past tense. Otherwise, add ‘ed’ to make it past tense. Save these past tense words to a list called past_tense
words = ["adopt", "bake", "beam", "confide", "grill", "plant", "time", "wave", "wish"]

past_tense = []
for i in words:
    if(i[len(i)-1] == 'e'):
        i += 'd'
    else:
        i += 'ed'
    past_tense.append(i)
